**Hi, I’m fancyfinn9!**
- I’m obsessed with statistics and chess. But because there's not much statistic opportunities in chess, I do football statistics instead
- I’m currently building a web scraper that gets me all sorts of data from the Premier League website
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's in Python and has to do with either chess, football, or Pokemon :D
- If you want to reach me, I'm on Discord (surprise surprise!). Find me under @fancyfinn9
