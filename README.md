**Hi, I’m fancyfinn9!**
- I’m obsessed with statistics and chess. And Pokémon.
- I’m currently building a program that allows users on Mastodon to use custom emojis from other instances!
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's in Python and has to do with either chess, football, or Pokémon :D
- If you want to reach me, fire me a message on Discord at @fancyfinn9
